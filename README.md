What is this?
-----------
This is a work in progress! The ultimate goal is a kind of "users' manual" for using mixed-effects models in R, especially with the `lme4` package. Right now, though, this is a repo for use in a workshop at the University of Maryland.

How do I download this?
-----------
If you've never used GitHub before, you can get all the stuff in this repo in a few different ways.  The slickest is with git itself.  The address for this repo is:

  https://github.com/shoestringpsycholing/useRmem.git

### Downloading ("cloning") with git

If you download the git program and start the git "bash" (the command-line shell -- the default installation in Windows installs a separate shell for use with git, so as not to interfere with the normal "cmd" shell), you can "clone" (i.e., download) the full contents of this repository by navigating to the folder where you want the repo dumped (using "cd" commands) and then type:

  git clone https://github.com/shoestringpsycholing/useRmem.git

This will download the whole thing right into your folder. Couldn't be easier.

If you use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/), and also install git, you can use git through RStudio itself.  It's pretty neat.  You can basically tell it to clone a repository, and if you point it to the above address, it should work.

### Downloading from the browser

If you don't have git or don't want to deal with it, you can download it "manually", too. If you go to [this address](https://github.com/shoestringpsycholing/startR ), you should see a little button that has the word "ZIP" with a little arrow coming from a cloud. This amazing iconography is telling you that you can download a .zip file from the cloud by clicking the button.  This is not false advertising.  The folder may be named something like "useRmem-master", though.  Just unzip the file, and you should have everything there.

Enjoy!
